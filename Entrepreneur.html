                        <h5>How it Started</h5>
                        <p>As far back as I can remember, I have been immersed in the dreams of small business owners. My father opened an office supply store when I was very small and, before I knew it, I was working behind the counter with him, negotiating with providers, calculating sales prices, and selling notebooks, pencils, tissue paper, and snacks to members of our neighborhood. Every customer we served loved my dad––he always made sure that his customers got what they needed. At it’s height, our small 200-square-foot store was packed from floor-to-ceiling with school supplies and gift bags, socks and chewing gum, and shoppers filled the store from open until close. In “fat” and “lean” years, my father always had the support of his many loyal customers who knew Don Ramón had their best interests at heart. From my years behind the counter with my dad, I learned the importance of genuine customer service in building a successful business.
                            In addition to my father, a number of other close family and friends opened small businesses during my youth, and I had the opportunity to work with many of them. At my uncle’s jewelry workshop, I saw firsthand all of the organization and coordination that goes into successfully managing a rapidly growing business and the value of hiring and retaining top quality employees. When my 21- year old cousin opened a video rental business, I became his first sales clerk at age 13. Shortly after I began working with him, he developed a computer program that managed our record-keeping much more efficiently than the handwritten system we previously used. With this innovation, I learned the value of developing and utilizing technology to support business operations.</p>
